# EE120B Final_Project-
Proposal
The final project that I will be workingg on is the jukebox. ﻿﻿The components I will be using are 3 buttons, LCD screen, breadboard, jumper cables, power, micro-controller. If time allows I would like to play with the design so that this actually looks like a jukebox if not I will just play it on my breadboard. a description of this is to have LCD display a welcome sign until the user starts toggling the buttons. Upon touching the (left and right buttons there will display a menu to choose music. There will also be one button for stop and one button for start. If there is time i will implement the feature that reacts to the song. I may use the LCD or just use some LEDs.

User Guide 
The jukebox works by initially (idle state) by showing a welcome screen that directs users on what to press next. After the user breaks out of the idle state the user can then toggle with A0 and A1 to choose the song of their choosing. When the user chooses their song of choosing the user presses the A3 button to play the song. The A2 button serves as a menu button. The menu takes the user back to the idle state where it shows the welcome screen.
